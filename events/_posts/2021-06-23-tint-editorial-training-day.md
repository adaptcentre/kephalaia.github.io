The event walks through the TiNT project, offers training on its digital editorial tools, and offers a chance to contribute to the project, both on the day and in the future. 

There is no obligation to continue to edit for the project, but it is a good opportunity to introduce research students to manuscript literacy and to find new avenues for collaboration. 

Lunch and coffee are included. 

Registrants will be emailed directly with a schedule closer to the day, but the event starts at 10:00 and we will head to the pub around 16:30. 

Participants should create an account on the [New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room](http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/) in advance, if they do not already have one, so that they can be added to the private project workspace.
