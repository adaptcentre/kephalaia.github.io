Kimberley A. Fowler (PhD, Manchester 2013) is a Postdoctoral Researcher on the TiNT Project at the University of Glasgow. Prior to coming to Glasgow, she held a lectureship in New Testament at Durham University and a postdoctoral position with the Centre national de la recherche scientifique exploring early Christianity’s relationship with the Roman Empire. She is the author of various articles, studies, and edited volumes on topics in the broad area of early Christianity, particularly the texts from the Coptic Nag Hammadi Library, with a focus on the production and reception context of the manuscripts and what this reveals about diverse early Christian reading practices.

Kimberley’s research within the TiNT project focuses on Coptic and Greek manuscripts witnessing non-canonical gospel and gospel-related texts, illuminating the roles of titles and paratextual material on both sides of the canonical boundary.
