Formerly a post-doctoral researcher on the TiNT project, Kimberley A. Fowler (PhD, Manchester 2013) is now Assistant Professor of New Testament at the University of Groningen. She has also held teaching and research positions in New Testament and early Christianity more broadly at Durham University (2018 - 2021) and the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (2015 - 2018). She is the author of various articles and studies on topics in the broad area of early Christianity, especially the texts from the Coptic Nag Hammadi Codices, with a focus on the production and reception context of the manuscripts and what this reveals about diverse early Christian reading practices. Her research at present continues to focus particularly on both canonical and non-canonical Christian literature, especially the paratextual features across Coptic and Greek manuscripts on both sides of the canonical boundary.
