Previously, he was part of the ERC CATENA project at the University of Birmingham, where his PhD on Greek catena manuscripts of Acts of the Apostles led to a reclassification of this tradition, now included in the online *Clavis Clavium* (ClaCla) database. Author of numerous publications, he is co-authoring a catalogue of the Euthalian Apparatus in New Testament manuscripts and an edition of Codex H (GA 015) for the *Annotating the New Testament* project, while also preparing monographs on commentary manuscripts. He has taught ancient languages for several years in the Classics department at the University of Birmingham and contributes to manuscript transcription for the International Greek New Testament Project and the Insular Latin Gospels transcription project
