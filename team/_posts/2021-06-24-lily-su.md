Lily T. Su is a PhD student in Theology & Religious Studies, and a team member of the TiNT project under the supervision of Dr. Garrick Allen. Lily completed her MDiv degree in Advanced Biblical Languages with honors from Shepherds Theological Seminary (USA) in August, 2020. Her work on the Greek Paul Project with the Museum of the Bible Scholars Initiative includes transcribing manuscripts of 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus for the *Editio Critica Maior* edition of the Pastoral Epistles.

Lily’s work on the TiNT Project involves collecting the various forms of the title as they appear in the Greek manuscripts to produce titular profiles for the manuscripts using the TiNT Project editorial tool. Her contribution to the TiNT Project is to explore the reception of authorship, date, and context of production of the Pastoral Epistles, using data gathered from the New Testament’s titular traditions. The titular features of the manuscripts will provide a window into the reception history, the provenance, and the production of the Pastorals.
