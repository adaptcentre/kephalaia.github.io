Kelsie Rodenbiker is a Research Associate at the University of Glasgow wï»¿here she is co-I on the [Paratexts Seeking Understanding project](https://mappingthemargins.com/). Her work focuses on margins and boundaries: paratextuality and the fluidity of the New Testament manuscript tradition; authorship, the canonical process, and the porousness of biblical authority; and textual relationships that create pathways between works and their interpretive and traditionary afterlives. Her first monograph, *[Scriptural Figures and the Fringes of the New Testament Canon](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/scriptural-figures-and-the-fringes-of-the-new-testament-canon-9780197763292?cc=gb&lang=en&)*, will be out in early 2025.
