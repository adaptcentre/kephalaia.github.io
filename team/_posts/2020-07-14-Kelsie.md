Kelsie G. Rodenbiker (PhD Durham, 2021) is a Postdoctoral Researcher with the TiNT project at the University of Glasgow. She completed her PhD thesis, entitled “Canonical Pseudonymity: Exemplarity and the Catholic Epistle Collection,” under the supervision of Professor Francis Watson. Her most recent publication, “The Claromontanus Stichometry and its Canonical Implications” is forthcoming from the Journal for the Study of the New Testament. She has also published on the role of Jewish scriptural exempla in the Catholic Epistles. Originally from Seattle, she is joined by her husband, Erin and their son, Willem.

Kelsie’s contribution to the TiNT project explores the tether between pseudonymous attribution and its material context, emphasizing the ongoing traditioning of authorial figures such as James, Peter, and John through the titular features found primarily in Greek manuscripts.
