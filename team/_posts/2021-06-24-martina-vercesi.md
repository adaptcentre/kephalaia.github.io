Martina Vercesi is a a research associate at the Research Unit Biblical Studies of KU Leuven’s Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies. She is a member of the Leuven Multilingual Manuscript Research Centre (LEMMA). Martina is working for the ERC-2021-COG project “BICROSS– The Significance of Bilingual Manuscripts for Detecting Cross-Language Interaction in the New Testament Tradition”, led by Prof. Dr. Dr. Christina M. Kreinecker. She is currently studying the bilingual Greek and Latin New Testament manuscripts, with a particular focus on “Western” readings. 

Martina earned her degree in Classics from the Università degli Studi di Milano, where she began working on textual criticism and the Synoptic Gospels. She pursued a PhD at the University of St Andrews (2022) under the supervision of Prof. Mark W. Elliott, [concentrating on the text and interpretation of Revelation 19-21 within the context of ancient North African Christian communities](https://www.mohrsiebeck.com/en/book/revelation-19-21-in-the-exegesis-of-early-christian-roman-africa-9783161634802/).

In 2021, Martina relocated to Glasgow to work on the ERC project "Titles of the New Testament: A New Approach to Manuscripts and the History of Interpretation" (TiNT), led by Prof. Garrick Allen. Within this context, she has focused on the diachronic development of paratextual traditions related to the gospels, while also examining the interactions between Greek and Latin in New Testament manuscripts. Her research interests encompass manuscripts, textual criticism, the Latin New Testament, the Gospels, and the Book of Revelation.
