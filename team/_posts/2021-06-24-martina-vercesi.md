Martina Vercesi is a Postdoctoral Researcher working for the TiNT project at the University of Glasgow. She graduated in Classics at the Università Statale di Milano, where she began working in  New Testament studies with research on textual criticism and the Synoptic Gospels. She completed her PhD in St Andrews (2022) with a thesis on the reception of Revelation 19–21 in the early North African Christian communities. 

Martina’s contribution to the TiNT project involves studying the diachronic development of paratextual traditions concerning the canonical gospels, also looking at the interaction between Greek and Latin in New Testament manuscripts.
