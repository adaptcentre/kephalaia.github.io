Martina is a PhD student at the University of St Andrews where she examines the reception of Revelation 19 – 21 in the early North African Christian Communities (II-V century) under the supervision of Professor Mark Elliott. She graduated in Classics at the Università Statale di Milano, where she began working in New Testament studies  with research on the Synoptic Gospels, especially textual criticism on the Gospel of Mark.

Martina’s contribution to the TiNT project involves studying the diachronic development of paratextual traditions concerning the canonical Gospels, with the aim to understand how this tradition appeared in Greek manuscripts, tracing also the routes of these titles in the history of other Christian communities.
