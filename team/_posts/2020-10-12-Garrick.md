He is the author of Manuscripts of the Book of Revelation: New Philology, Paratexts, Reception (Oxford University Press, 2020) and The Book of Revelation and Early Jewish Textual Culture (Cambridge University Press, 2017), along with multiple articles, edited books, and translations. He is also the recipient of the Manfred Lautenschlaeger Award for Theological Promise (2019) and the Paul J. Achtemeier Award for New Testament Scholarship (2018).
