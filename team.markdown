Garrick V. Allen (PhD St Andrews, 2015) is Senior Lecturer in New Testament Studies at the University of Glasgow. He is the author of Manuscripts of the Book of Revelation: New Philology, Paratexts, Reception (Oxford University Press, 2020) and The Book of Revelation and Early Jewish Textual Culture (Cambridge University Press, 2017), along with multiple articles, edited books, and translations. He is also the recipient of the Manfred Lautenschlaeger Award for Theological Promise (2019) and the Paul J. Achtemeier Award for New Testament Scholarship (2018). In addition to the TiNT project, he is the Principal Investigator on the Paratextual Understanding project, funded by the Templeton Religion Trust.

Garrick’s work on the TiNT project revolves around the features of the Euthalian apparatus to Acts, the Pauline Epistles, and the Catholic epistles, focusing especially on the chapter lists and quotation lists in different manuscripts.

Kelsie G. Rodenbiker (PhD Durham, 2021) is a Postdoctoral Researcher with the TiNT project at the University of Glasgow. She completed her PhD thesis, entitled “Canonical Pseudonymity: Exemplarity and the Catholic Epistle Collection,” under the supervision of Professor Francis Watson. Her most recent publication, “The Claromontanus Stichometry and its Canonical Implications” is forthcoming from the Journal for the Study of the New Testament. She has also published on the role of Jewish scriptural exempla in the Catholic Epistles. Originally from Seattle, she is joined by her husband, Erin and their son, Willem.

Kelsie’s contribution to the TiNT project explores the tether between pseudonymous attribution and its material context, emphasizing the ongoing traditioning of authorial figures such as James, Peter, and John through the titular features found primarily in Greek manuscripts.
