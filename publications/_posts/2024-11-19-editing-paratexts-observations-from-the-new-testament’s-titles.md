This article explores the complex theoretical and practical issues involved in editing paratextual features in Greek New Testament manuscripts and the many possible critical research questions to which this type of collaborative work contributes. Reflecting on the ongoing work of the ‘Titles of the New Testament’ (TiNT) project based at the University of Glasgow, we outline the challenges involved in working digitally with a large and heterogenous manuscript corpus and discuss some of the editorial steps we have taken to enable the construction of a titular search tool and our own research questions on this corpus. We ultimately conclude that our digital editorial practices stand in a long line of annotating activity that can be traced back as far as the scribes and craftspeople who produced the manuscripts we continue to explore in this project.
